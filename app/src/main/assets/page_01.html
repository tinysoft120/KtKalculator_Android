    <div style="padding:0px;">The Karat Kalculator is a tool to estimate the practical value of your Karat Gold Scrap.<br />
      <br />
      Simply select your measurement unit on the main Kalculator page and enter your weights under each specific karat field. To calculate the total value, you can tap calculate or the results tab on the bottom of the screen.  The results screen will show you the total estimated net value of your refining lot minus any associated charges, plus much more useful information.<br />
      <br />
      When you first open the Karat Kalculator app it will obtain the most current gold price from www.midstatesrecycling.com.  This price will be displayed on the Kalculator page and the Gold Price page.  The gold price can be adjusted to any future price of your choice by either tapping the gold price on the Kalculator page or changing it on the Gold Price page.<br />
      <br />
      In our 30 years of experience we have found most karat gold jewelry scrap to average approximately a Â½ karat under its plumb stamp.  Because of this we have built the Karat Kalculator to mimic the recoveries for each grade of Karat Gold that our historical data indicates.  Final settlements will be based on the actual melt & assay results at appropriate current gold market, less applicable treatment and refining charges.</div>
